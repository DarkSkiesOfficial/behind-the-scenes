# DarkSkies Behind-The-Scenes/Character Archives

✨ A repository of behind-the-scenes material for my released characters.

This isn’t  a collection of finished cards. It’s the **full creative fossil record**: the drafts, the alternate looks, the half-forgotten seeds, and the messy notes that led to each character. If you’re interested in process, evolution, or just peeking at the “cutting room floor,” this is for you.

## 📂 What’s Inside

Each character has their own folder. Inside, you may find:

* **Alternate main images** — generations that were once contenders or past covers
* **Outfits** — fancy dress, swimsuit, or alternate looks that didn’t make the cut
* **Previous character card versions** — evolution of voice, traits, and polish
* **Playlist art** — full-size art from their character-specific Spotify playlists
* **Reference data** — face references, body measurements, and design notes
* **Seed ideas** — original prompts or profiles that sparked the character
* **Author’s notes** — stray thoughts, context, or personal commentary

Not every character will have every category, but each folder is curated cleanly and consistently.

## 🎭 Purpose

This repo is for:

* Fellow creators curious about *process*
* Fans who want to see alternate versions and discarded treasures
* Archivists who believe no idea should vanish without a trace

It’s not meant as a polished showcase, but as a **backstage pass** to how my characters come alive.

## 🚀 How to Use

* Browse by character folder
* Open anything that interests you (images, notes, versions)
* Use them for inspiration, study, or just curiosity

*(Please respect that while these resources are shared freely, the characters themselves remain my creative work.)*

## 💌 Closing Thought

Characters aren’t born in a single draft — they’re stitched together from trial, error, and a lot of strange little sparks. This repo is a scrapbook of those sparks.
