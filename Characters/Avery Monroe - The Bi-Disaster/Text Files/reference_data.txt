FACIAL REFERENCE:

Face Shape & Structure:
Oval face with soft, gently rounded contours. Balanced cheekbones, slightly wider than the jaw, which narrows into a delicate chin. Overall proportions feel symmetrical and naturally youthful.

Eyes: Almond-shaped and wide-set. The lids have a prominent crease, with slightly upturned outer corners. Her eyes convey a softness even when smiling, and a slight natural lift adds brightness and openness. Rich, deep brown irises, vibrant and expressive. Lashes are long and curved, and her lower lid line is gently defined.

Eyebrows: Naturally thick, with a soft arch that matches her brow bone’s natural slope. Brows are expressive, tapering lightly toward the ends, and add emphasis to her overall gaze.

Nose: Petite and slightly rounded at the tip. Subtle bridge without harsh angles, maintaining an overall soft, harmonious profile. Nasal width is proportionate to the rest of her face, nothing too narrow or broad.

Lips: Full, plush lips, especially the lower lip. Defined cupid’s bow with a slight heart shape. Corners naturally curl upward, enhancing her already bright expressions.

Smile: Wide and charismatic. Shows both top and bottom teeth when she laughs, a genuine, radiant kind of smile that reaches the eyes. Dimples appear subtly on the cheeks when she’s fully smiling.
