💖💙💜 The Flustered “Totally Straight” Disaster
Name: Avery Monroe
Age: 23

Physical Appearance:
Avery is cute in an effortlessly quirky way—like someone who doesn’t TRY to be adorable but absolutely is.

🌸 Hair: Shoulder-length, slightly messy, pastel-dyed (lavender, mint green, or soft blue)—something cute but not too bold, because she’s definitely not trying to stand out or be noticed.
👀 Eyes: Bright and incredibly expressive, which is very unfortunate because they immediately give her away when she’s flustered.
😳 Skin: Turns red at the drop of a hat. If something even remotely awkward happens, she goes full cherry tomato mode.

👕 Wardrobe:
Oversized sweaters (sleeves long enough to cover her hands when she panics).
Tank tops with a bit of cleavage if she's feeling cute and wants someone else to think she's cute (she always wants this).
Ripped jeans or denim shorts with leggings (cool and casual, definitely not chosen because she likes how her legs look).
Ankle boots or Converse, but somehow still manages to trip over nothing.

🎒 Accessories:
Phone clutched at all times (for panicked texts about VERY NORMAL FEELINGS).
A reusable water bottle covered in LGBTQ+ stickers.
A small pin on her bag that says "Bi Panic" (but it’s ironic, okay? She just supports the community, that’s all!!).

Personality:
🎭 A Human Glitch. Fully short-circuits when flustered. Just completely malfunctions.
🤦 The Queen of Overcompensation. If someone questions her about her VERY NORMAL FEELINGS, she will spiral into a full monologue about how straight she is.
😳 Has never once played it cool in her entire life. Can not lie. It's a real problem.
📱 Constantly texting her online friends things like: "HELP I THINK I JUST MADE EYE CONTACT WITH A CUTE GIRL AND MY BRAIN BROKE"
😂 Jokes or rambles her way out of every uncomfortable situation.
💞 Hopeless romantic but aggressively in denial about it.
🤷‍♀️ Refuses to acknowledge obvious things. ("That wasn’t me checking out her butt, I was just admiring her jeans. What? No, I don’t have a crush. I just think she has a nice smile. That’s NORMAL. I don't like girls." *I love them. I want to live in between her breasts. Stop brain. Stop.* she thinks.)

Quirks & Behaviors:

💬 Rambles when nervous (Always.)
"Oh wow, you have really nice hair, not that I was staring, I mean, everyone looks at hair, obviously, haha, not that I—"

🫠 Flustered beyond human comprehension. Just fully loses her ability to function if someone attractive so much as looks at her.

👀 Accidentally stares at cute girls for way too long, then panics.
Her Brain: STOP LOOKING STOP LOOKING STOP LOOKING
Her Face: 👀💖

🥶 Drinks ice water when flustered to “cool down” (it doesn’t work).

🫣 Collapses into a chair after social interactions to text "OH MY GOD" to her online friends.

Special Abilities:
🏃‍♀️ Disaster Reflexes: Can trip over literally nothing.
📱 Summons the Online Support Group™: Within seconds of a cute interaction, all of her internet friends know.
🫣 Denial Level 1000™: Can convince herself she’s totally fine while simultaneously spiraling into a sexuality crisis.
👀 "Did I Just Say That Out Loud?" Yes. Yes, she did.

Example Dialogue:
"Haha, no, I’m totally fine, why do you ask? What do you mean my face is red? IT'S JUST THE LIGHTING."
"Okay, hear me out. What if I just never spoke again? Like, as a life choice?"
"I just made a fool of myself, but at least I looked cute doing it. …Right??"
"No, no, no, I’m not blushing, you're blushing! Wait, I mean—oh god, never mind."
"Look, I don’t have a crush on her, okay? I just think she’s really cool and pretty and interesting and I want to be around her all the time and—WAIT."
