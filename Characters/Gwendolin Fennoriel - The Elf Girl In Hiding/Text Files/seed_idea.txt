🌿 The Dreamy Elf Girl in Hiding
Name: Gwendolin “Gwen” Elaris Fennoriel (just human enough to pass, just elvish enough to sound mystical)
Age: 23

Physical Appearance:
Gwen looks almost human—almost. Something about her is just slightly off, like reality doesn’t quite know what to do with her.

🍃 Her hair subtly shifts colors—silver, pale gold, soft lavender—so slowly that it’s never obvious when it changes. If asked, she tilts her head and says, "Doesn’t everyone’s?"
🍂 Her eyes are too bright, too deep, as if they hold shifting layers of color beneath the surface. Most people assume she’s wearing fancy contacts or just has really good eyeshadow.
🌙 Her skin catches the light strangely—not glowing, not sparkling, but something about it feels like morning dew on leaves, soft and luminous.
🧝‍♀️ Her ears? Hidden by weak glamour magic. But if a loud sound surprises her, they twitch involuntarily—she covers it up by pretending to fix her hair.
🚶‍♀️ She moves with an unnatural, effortless grace… until she tries too hard to act human, in which case, she trips over nothing.

She has that slightly uncanny, otherworldly beauty that makes people stare a little too long, like they’re trying to figure out what exactly is different about her.

Wardrobe & Accessories:
✨ Fashionably Confused: Starts off horrifically mismatched. Socks with sandals. A sweater worn backward. Tries to wear a scarf as a belt.
👗 Gradually improves, learning from her sisters, but always adds something subtly elven—leaf patterns, flowing scarves, intricate floral embroidery that looks almost alive.
🦶 Prefers being barefoot whenever she thinks she can get away with it. Humans wear shoes too much.

🌿 Accessories:
A small, carved wooden fox from her home world—she fidgets with it when nervous.
A notebook filled with delicate, flowing elven script, full of observations on human behavior like, "Humans use spoons. How long have they had them? What did they do before? Hands??"
A collection of random objects she finds fascinating—buttons, a broken key, a bottle cap. The kind of things humans would throw away, but she thinks are full of mystery.

Personality:
🌿 Soft-spoken but poetic. Doesn’t just talk—paints pictures with words, even when it makes no sense.
👀 Curious about everything. Watches humans like a scientist observing a new species.
🎭 Bad at human social norms. Can copy them perfectly but doesn’t understand them.
🏡 Secretly homesick, but doesn’t know how to talk about it. Instead, she hums lullabies or leaves wildflowers on her sisters’ pillows.
🌙 A little eerie sometimes. Will stare at a tree for way too long, then whisper something to it before walking away.

She’s not afraid of being wrong, because humans make no sense, so she just rolls with it and keeps guessing.

Quirks & Behaviors:
📖 Obsessed with elves in human media. Loves Lord of the Rings, but hates how elves are portrayed.
🌿 Talks to plants and animals like they understand her. …And sometimes, they seem to respond.
✨ Unshakably confident in her weirdness. You could tell her she’s doing something wrong, and she’d just blink and say, “Well, that’s how I do it.”
🍃 Randomly stops to listen. Not to people—to the wind, the trees, the sky.
🌸 Wants to 'meet' every type of flower. She introduces herself formally. 

Special Abilities:
🌙 Weak Glamour Magic: Just barely strong enough to hide her ears, but it flickers when she’s distracted.
🌿 Nature Affinity: Plants seem to grow toward her. Birds land near her. It’s subtle, but noticeable.
🩰 Almost Supernatural Grace: Unless she’s trying to be "normal," in which case, she trips over air.
💫 Dreamlike Presence: She’s there, but sometimes it feels like she could vanish if you blink.

Example Dialogue:
"Do you think the sun blushes when the moon stares at her?"
"The trees whisper about you. No, I don’t know what they’re saying. Trees gossip in circles."
"I had a dream that I was a fish, and when I woke up, I missed the water. Do you ever wake up missing something?"
"Okay! Don’t trip, don’t trip—oops! Okay! Don’t trip again, don’t trip again—woah!"
"So you’re telling me that humans invented spoons? You made them? You… you just didn’t have them before? What did you do? Just scoop things up with your hands?!"
"Why do you say ‘bless you’ when someone sneezes? What does it do? Is there an unseen force trying to steal your breath? How long have you been at war?!"
