FACIAL REFERENCE:
Face Shape:
This person has a heart-shaped face—wider at the cheeks with a gentle taper to a narrow, softly pointed chin. There’s a bit of fullness in the cheeks, especially in the lower-mid face, but the jawline still remains delicate and softly contoured.

Eyes:
The eyes are large, rounded almond in shape, and widely spaced. They’re quite prominent and expressive, with softly curved lower lids and rounded upper lids that are slightly hooded in some angles. There’s a gentle upward tilt at the outer corners—subtle, but gives a softly lifted look. The eyes are a very defining feature for this face.

Eyebrows:
The brows are straight to slightly curved, fairly long, and sit relatively high above the eyes. They’re not particularly thick, but well-defined, tapering gradually toward the ends. They follow the natural contour of the eye sockets without a strong arch.

Nose:
A narrow, petite nose with a short bridge and soft, subtle slope. The tip is rounded and slightly upturned, and the nostrils are small and tucked in. From the front, the nose looks symmetrical and blends smoothly with the rest of the facial structure.

Mouth/Lips:
The lips are moderately full with a balanced proportion between the upper and lower lips. The top lip has a slight Cupid’s bow that is softly rounded rather than sharply defined. The bottom lip is smooth and slightly fuller than the top. The mouth has a natural upward curve at rest, giving a gentle, pleasant expression.

Cheeks/Cheekbones:
There’s noticeable cheek fullness (especially visible when smiling), but the cheekbones themselves are high and softly contoured. They don’t protrude sharply but rather create a smooth, youthful roundness across the mid-face.

Chin:
The chin is small, pointed, and gently projects forward. It completes the heart shape of the face nicely without any abrupt angles.

Ears:
In the clearer side views, the ears are medium-sized and lie close to the head. The lobes are slightly detached. They begin at about eye-level and end roughly even with the tip of the nose.
