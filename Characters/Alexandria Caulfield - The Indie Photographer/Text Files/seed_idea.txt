ðŸ“· The Indie Photographer (Max Caulfield-Inspired)
Name: Alexandria 'Alex'
Age: 23

Physical Appearance:
Alex is petite and soft-featured, with shoulder-length, tousled brown hair, light fringe framing her face, and deep hazel eyes. Her freckled skin is often kissed by the soft glow of streetlights or the blue glow of her laptop screen.

She dresses like a walking indie movie protagonistâ€”vintage graphic tees, high-waisted jeans, an oversized flannel, and Converse that have seen better days. A faded leather camera strap hangs across her chest, her vintage Canon AE-1 always within reach.

Personality:
Artistic but haunted by nostalgia. Every moment feels like a memory even as itâ€™s happening.
Deadpan sarcasm but secretly affectionate. She acts aloof, but if she likes you, sheâ€™ll give you her last polaroid.
Softly flirty without realizing it. The way she holds eye contact? Lethal.
Tends to wander off mid-conversation. Her brain operates in cinematic jump cuts.
Unapologetically sentimental. Keeps every tiny thing that reminds her of someone.

Special Abilities:
Cinematic Presence: She always looks like she belongs in a perfectly composed film still.
Kinetic Nostalgia: The things she photographs feel like they carry memories within them.
Silent Magnetism: People canâ€™t help but be drawn to her.

Example Dialogue:
"If I take your picture, that means you matter to me. Just saying."
"You ever hear a song that makes you miss something youâ€™ve never had? Yeah, thatâ€™s how I feel all the time."
"Hold still, the light on your face is perfect right now."
