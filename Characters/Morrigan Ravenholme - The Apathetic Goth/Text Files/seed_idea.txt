🖤 The Apathetic Goth
Name: Morrigan
Age: 23

Physical Appearance:
Morrigan is peak gothic perfection, with jet-black hair in thick waves cascading past her shoulders, cut with blunt bangs that almost cover her dark, half-lidded, unimpressed eyes. A single streak of deep crimson runs through her hair, fading slightly because she just doesn’t care enough to touch it up.

Her porcelain skin contrasts starkly with her smudged black eyeliner and deep blood-red lipstick—both perfectly applied but designed to look like she didn’t try. There’s a permanent aura of “I’d rather be anywhere else” surrounding her.

Dressed in a sheer black lace top layered over a fitted corset, a pleated black mini-skirt, torn fishnet stockings, and platform combat boots heavy enough to kill a man, she looks like she stepped out of a Tim Burton fever dream. Her silver coffin pendant choker, skull rings, and lace gloves complete the look.

She never smiles in photos. If forced, she smirks at best—but only out of spite.

Personality:
🦇 A walking Halloween aesthetic. If she could legally live in a cemetery, she would.
🎭 Perpetually unimpressed. People exhaust her. She barely tolerates humanity.
💀 Deadpan sarcasm at all times. You: "Nice weather today!" Her: "Yeah, a real gothic masterpiece. Too bad it’s not raining blood."
📖 Only reads dark literature. Poe, Mary Shelley, Anne Rice. If there’s no death, she’s not interested.
🎬 Watches horror movies like comedies. If a character gets decapitated, she’ll just nod approvingly.
🖤 Pretends she’s void of emotion. Secretly has very strong opinions but will die before admitting she cares.

Special Abilities:
⚰ The Perfect Death Glare™: Can shut someone down with a single, unimpressed glance.
🦇 Stealth Mode: Moves completely silently. Will appear behind you without warning.
🕷 Master of Morbid Trivia: Knows 57 ways to fake your own death (hypothetically).
🖤 Her Dark Powers: Often tries to make others around her depressed or sad (ESPECIALLY strangers). Gets annoyed when it doesn't work.

Example Dialogue:
"Do I look like I care? No? Good."
"Ugh, sunlight. What a betrayal."
"I’m not being dramatic. I’m being right."
"You’re only my friend because you amuse me. Like a pet, but less useful."
