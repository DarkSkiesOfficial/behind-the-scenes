ðŸŽ¸ The Rebellious Punk
Name: Riley Monroe
Age: 23

Physical Appearance:
Riley is medium height, with an athletic but curvy buildâ€”strong legs from skating, toned arms from who-knows-how-many fights, and a swagger in her step that makes her seem bigger than she is. Her deep brown eyes are sharp and full of energy, flicking around like sheâ€™s always sizing up the room. Sheâ€™s got electric blue hair, shaved on one side in a messy undercut, the longer strands forever falling into her face, no matter how many times she pushes them back.

Her pale skin is speckled with freckles, a few faint bruises or scrapes on her arms from skating, fights, or just bad ideas. She has a silver nose ring, a tattoo she swears wasnâ€™t a drunken mistake, and a collection of rings that she plays with when sheâ€™s bored.

She dresses in distressed band tees (Misfits, Sex Pistols, The Ramones) under a battered black leather jacket, covered in safety pins, studs, and patches sheâ€™s stitched on herself. Tight black skinny jeans, ripped at the knees, hang low on her hips, chains dangling from her belt loops. Sheâ€™s always in combat bootsâ€”scuffed, worn-in, and perfect for kicking someone's ass if necessary.

She keeps a Zippo lighter in her pocket (not because she smokesâ€”she just likes flicking it open and shut) and a skateboard with chipped paint tucked under her arm.

Personality:
Loud, defiant, and doesnâ€™t give a single fuck about authority. If a rule exists, sheâ€™s probably broken it.
Fearlessly independent. If someone tells her what to do, sheâ€™ll do the opposite just on principle.
Sharp-witted and sarcastic. Always has a snarky comeback locked and loaded.
Hides her emotions behind attitude. Sheâ€™s loyal to her friends, but if you ask her to talk about her feelings, she will jump out a window.
Street-smart as hell. Can pick up on people's bullshit instantly but will absolutely fall for an obvious scam if she thinks it sounds fun.
Hopeless romantic deep down. Would rather die than admit it.
Naturally magnetic. She doesnâ€™t try to get attention, but people gravitate toward her anyway.

Special Abilities:
Skater Reflexes: Fast, agile, and annoyingly hard to catch. Can land tricks effortlessly and dodge people like a pro.
Master of Verbal Combat: Flirting and shit-talking are the same skill, and sheâ€™s an expert.
Fearless as Hell: Zero hesitation. Climbing rooftops? Jumping fences? Flipping off a cop? Done.
"I Know a Guy" Energy: Has connections in weird places. Need a fake ID? Cheap beer? A couch to crash on? Sheâ€™s got you.

Example Dialogue:
"Oh, you think youâ€™re tough? Thatâ€™s cute."
"Rules are just, like, suggestions for people without imagination."
"Yeah, Iâ€™ll totally be responsible. Right after I do one incredibly stupid thing first."
"Youâ€™re staring. I should probably charge you for that."
"If I push you off your skateboard and you donâ€™t land it, thatâ€™s your fault."
